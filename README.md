## Project Summary
This project involved creating a banking app for **Airgead Banking**. The goal was to allow users to calculate their investment growth based on an initial investment, monthly deposits, interest rate, and the number of years they plan to invest. The main challenge was to display two scenarios:
1. Investment growth without any monthly investment.
2. Investment growth with monthly contributions.

The app provides users with the ability to visualize how their investments will grow over time, with a primary focus on monthly investments.

## What Did I Do Particularly Well?
I feel that I did a great job implementing a menu system that clearly displayed each investment scenario. Additionally, I effectively incorporated multiple functions, making the app easy to navigate. I also utilized **for loops** to handle repetitive tasks, which helped streamline the code and ensure accurate calculations for each year of investment.

## Areas for Code Enhancement
Although the app works as intended, there are areas where I could make improvements to increase efficiency and functionality:
- **Optimize loops**: I could explore using other methods besides for loops to perform calculations more efficiently.
- **Data Persistence**: I could enhance the app by allowing it to save user input (such as investment details) to a file. This would allow users to save their data and pick up where they left off in future sessions, making the app more user-friendly and versatile.

## Most Challenging Parts of the Code
The most challenging part of the project was calculating **compound interest**. I overcame this challenge by revisiting concepts from my Programming Languages course to ensure that I applied the correct formula and syntax. By troubleshooting and debugging the code, I was able to ensure that the interest calculations were accurate over time.

## Transferable Skills
This project helped me develop several skills that are transferable to other projects:
- **Problem-solving**: By utilizing past knowledge, I was able to break down complex problems (like compound interest) and solve them efficiently.
- **Attention to detail**: This project reinforced the importance of checking for syntax errors and ensuring the logic flows correctly.
- **Function and structure organization**: I learned how to structure code using multiple functions, which is a valuable skill for maintaining and scaling future projects.

## How Did I Make This Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable?
To ensure the program is maintainable and easy to extend, I included several **comments** throughout the code to explain the logic behind key sections. This makes the code more understandable for anyone who may work on the project in the future. Additionally, I designed the app so that new features or functions could be added or removed without disrupting the programâ€™s flow, making it adaptable for future improvements or changes.
