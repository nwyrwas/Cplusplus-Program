# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project, I had to create a banking app for the company Airgead Banking where I made a flow chart and then I created the code for the app. Where I displayed an initial investment, monthly deposit, interest rate and number of years for investment. The main problem was displaying both a balance without a monthly investment and a function where I had to display with a monthly investment. Just so I could show users how their investments will grow over time. While having the main focus on monthly investments.


What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I did very well on creating a menu displaying each amount. While also incorporating different functions that are called. While also incorporating for loops in them.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance my code by trying to find a more efficient way to code or tackle this situation. For example I could possibly use other ways than for loops. Or possibly having the code create and write files. Just so when the user opens the program it would be able to save what they input for future use. 


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

For me it was calculating the compound interest, I overcame this by reviewing what I learned in my Programming Languages to see what I would be missing at times. And ensuring that I had correct syntax for when I would be developing the code. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Being able to use past knowledge to allow me to succeed in creating a high quality product. While also paying attention to detail to allow myself to find and correct any mistakes or syntax errors that I create.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used multiple comments to ensure that it was easily readable for anyone that would try to develop this project further. While also making it easy to adjust or add/remove any functions to make the program more high-quality.
